### Introduction
php_pivotal_tracker is currently a bare-bones implementation of the Pivotal Tracker API in PHP.

It has the core features to do function calls using CURL for requests.

Please send pull requests if you make any additions for projects you have.

The code has not been extensively tested. Use at your own risk.

### TODO
*   Error handling (internally and over REST)
*   Finish implementing all API functions
*   Encoding checks
